# ‚öóÔ∏è Project

Project is a container for tasks, environments, and configurations. A project consists of several Zaruba scripts and all necessary resources.

Your main Zaruba script should be located at `main.zaruba.yaml`.

Every Zaruba script contains several optional keys:

```yaml
name: yourProjectName # optional
includes: [] # included Zaruba scripts
tasks: [] # task definitions
inputs: {} # Inputs
configs: {} # Map of configuration set
envs: {} # Map of environment set
```

* üç≤ `includes`: List of Zaruba scripts you want to include. Every scripts included in `main.zaruba.yaml` are automatically linked to each others.
* ‚úîÔ∏è `tasks`: Map of task definitions.
* üî¢ `inputs`: Map of predefined values that can be configured on runtime (interactively or by parameters). Inputs can be shared among tasks (i.e: several tasks probably access the same input).
* üìï `configs`: Map of config set. Each config should have a single value. Several tasks probably depend on the same config set.
* üõ§Ô∏è `envs`: Map of environments. Several tasks probably depend on the same env set.

# üç≤ Includes

Some of your tasks probably need some resources from other Zaruba script.

Include mechanism allows you to include other Zaruba script file into your main script. Every zaruba scripts included in your main script will be automatically linked to each other. Thus, you only need to put `includes` in your `main.zaruba.yaml`.

For example you want to include resources from `./zaruba-tasks/my-other-project-file.zaruba.yaml` and `${HOME}/common-task.zaruba.yaml`. In that case, you can put this in your `main.zaruba.yaml`.

```yaml
includes:
- zaruba-tasks/my-other-project-file.zaruba.yaml
- ${HOME}/common-task.yaml
```

## üåç Global Include

If you want your scripts to be available from every project in your computer, you can add them into `ZARUBA_SCRIPT` environment. Please make sure that your script paths are absolute.

For example you want `${HOME}/common-task.zaruba.yaml` and `${HOME}/make-coffee.zaruba.yaml`. In that case, you can put this in your `.profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`:

```sh
export ZARUBA_SCRIPT=${HOME}/common-task.zaruba.yaml:${HOME}/make-coffee.zaruba.yaml
```

This trick is going to be useful if you have common stateless tools like scaffolding or cofee-maker-automation that should be accessible from anywhere. Otherwise, local include (i.e: using `includes` key in your main project) is preferable.

# ‚úîÔ∏è Tasks

A project typically has more than one tasks that extend/depend to each other. A task typically contains several optional keys:

```yaml
tasks:

  taskName:
    location: ./task-location
    description: task's description
    extend: parentTaskName # use "extends" for multiple values
    timeout: 1h
    private: false
    inputs: [] # list of input's name
    dependencies: [] # tasks's dependencies
    envRef: envRefName # use "envRefs" for multiple values
    env: {}
    configRef: configRefName # use "configRefs" for multiple values
    config: {}
    start: [] # start command
    check: [] # check command
```

* üìç `location`: Task location, relative to your current project file path. For example, if your project file path is `~/project/zaruba-tasks/service.yaml` and you set the `location` to be `../service`, then your task location is `~/project/service`.
* üìú `description`: Multi line text describing the task.
* üîº `extend`: Parent task name. Mutually exclusive to `extends` (i.e: You cannot use  both simultaneously).
* üîº `extends`: List of parent task names. Mutually exclusive to `extend` (i.e: You cannot use both simultaneously). 
* ‚è∞ `timeout`: The duration before a task is considered timeout. Timeout contains a possitive number or zero and followed by any of this suffix: "ns", "us" (or "¬µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
* üîí `private`: Boolean, define whether your task is private or not. Private tasks are interactively inaccessible. Usually private tasks act as template to be extended by other tasks.
* üî¢ `inputs`: List of input names you want to associate with the task.
* üîÄ `dependencies`: Task dependencies. Zaruba will make sure that all dependencies are completed before starting the task.
* üõ§Ô∏è `envRef`: Environment reference to be used in the task. Mutually exclusive to `envRefs` (i.e: you cannot use both simultaneously).
* üõ§Ô∏è `envRefs`: List of environment references to be used in the task. Mutually exclusive to `envRef`(i.e: you cannot use both simultaneously).
* üõ§Ô∏è `env`: Task environment. This will override `envRef` or `envRefs`.
* üìï `configRef`: Config reference to be used in the task. Mutually exclusive to `configRefs` (i.e: you cannot use both simultaneously).
* üìï `configRefs`: List of configuration references to be used in the task. Mutually exclusive to `configRef`(i.e: you cannot use both simultaneously).
* üìï `config`: Task configuration. This will override `configRef` or `configRefs`.
* üöÄ `start`: Task's start command.
* üîé `check`: Task's check command.

Let's get into them, one drop at a time.

## ‚òòÔ∏è Task Type

There are three different task types in Zaruba:

* üöÄ `Command Task`: Short command. Terminated upon completion. To make a command task, you should provide `start` command and leave `check` command empty.
* üèÅ `Service Task`: Long running process. Keep running after completion. To make a service task, you should provide both `start` and `check` command.
* üì¶ `Wrapper Task`: A task that wrap another tasks as it's dependencies, but doing nothing on it's own (no `start` or `check` command).

## üöÄ Command Task

At the very basic, a command task should contain a single `start` command. A command task is considered "completed" once the command has been executed.

Please take a look at the following example:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  sayHello:
    start:
    - figlet
    - hello world
```

We have `sayHello` task with single `start` command: `[figlet, hello world]`.

You can run the task by invoking:

```sh
zaruba please sayHello
```
![Simple command task](images/concept-simple-command-task.png)

> __Fun fact:__ Figlet is a program for making large letters out of ordinary text. If you are using ubuntu, you can install figlet by invoking `sudo apt-get install figlet`. Visit [figlet official website](http://www.figlet.org/) for more information.

## üìï Config

You can make your task more configurable by adding `config` to it. Let's see the following example:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  print:
    config:
      sentence: hello world
    start:
    - figlet
    - '{{ .GetConfig "sentence" }}'
```

Now you can modify the sentence without touching the `start` command.

You can think of `config` as `attribute` or `property` in object-oriented programming. On its own, `config` is not very useful. To see how powerful it is, you need to combine it with `extend`.

To get a `config` value, you can use `{{ .GetConfig "configName" }}`.

> __Note:__ You can use [go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) in every `config` value, `start` command, and `check` command.

### ü§ù Sharing Config

Some of your tasks probably need to share config. In that case, you can use `configRef` or `configRefs`. For example:

```yaml
tasks:

  showNatriumSymbol:
    configRef: sodium
    start:
    - figlet
    - 'Natrium: {{ .GetConfig "symbol" }}'
  
  showSodiumSymbol:
    configRefs: [sodium, other]
    start:
    - figlet
    - 'Sodium: {{ .GetConfig "symbol" }}'


configRef:

  sodium:
    symbol: Na
  
  other:
    commonName: sodium
```

`showNatriumSymbol` has a single config reference, `sodium`. This config reference is also shared with `showSodiumSymbol`. However, `showSodiumSymbol` also has another config reference, `other`.

Thus, `showNatriumSymbol` has one config:
* `symbol`: Na

While `showSodiumSymbol` has two configs:
* `symbol`: Na
* `commonName`: sodium

## üîº Extend

Just like in object-oriented programming, you can use `extend` to extend your task. Let's check the following example:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  print:
    config:
      sentence: '<empty>'
    start:
    - figlet
    - '{{ .GetConfig "sentence" }}'

  
  sayHello:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: hello
  

  sayCheese:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: cheese
```

Now we have `sayHello` and `sayCheese`. Just as their parent (i.e: `print`), both tasks will invoke `figlet` as well. However, since they have different `sentence` config, those two tasks will yield different results as well.

```sh
zaruba please sayHello
zaruba please sayCheese
```

![Extend](images/concept-extend.png)

Using `extend` is not only save you from writing the same parts over and over. It also allows you to change task's implementation without affecting it's children.

## üîº Extending core.runShellScript

Let's say you want to use [toilet](https://github.com/cacalabs/toilet) instead of figlet, then you can modify `print` task as follow:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  print:
    config:
      sentence: '<empty>'
    start:
    - bash
    - '-c'
    - toilet -f mono12 -F metal '{{ .GetConfig "sentence" }}'
```

Looks good. But, before we continue any further, try to run `zaruba please core.runShellScript -x`. 

![core.runShellScript explanation](images/concept-explain-core-runShellScript.png)

`core.runShellScript` is part of zaruba's core tasks. Core tasks are always accessible from anywhere.

Based on the explanation, you can see that `core.runShellScript` has several `config` values. You can use those configurations (i.e: `setup`, `beforeStart`, `start`, `afterStart`, `cmd`, and `cmdArg`) to configure the `start` command.

In our case, we can simply extend `core.runShellScript` and override it's `start` config:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  print:
    extend: core.runShellScript
    config:
      sentence: '<empty>'
      start: toilet -f mono12 -F metal '{{ .GetConfig "sentence" }}'

  
  sayHello:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: hello
  

  sayCheese:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: cheese
```

So, here is how things look like:

![Extending core.runShellScript](images/concept-extend-from-core-runShellScript.png)

## üî¢ Inputs

Since our `print` task is configurable, you can extend it and make as many tasks as you need. However, you can also use `inputs` to let your user customize your configuration.

Let's check out the following example:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
inputs:

  user.sentence:
    default: hi
    options: [yo, what's up]
    prompt: Write something
    description: |
      User sentence, cannot be empty.
    validation: ^.+$


tasks:

  print:
    extend: core.runShellScript
    inputs:
    - user.sentence
    config:
      sentence: '{{ .GetValue "user.sentence" }}'
      start: toilet -f mono12 -F metal '{{ .GetConfig "sentence" }}'

  
  sayHello:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: hello
  

  sayCheese:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: cheese
```

Now you have an input named `user.sentence`. It's value cannot be blank since the [regex](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) `validation` require at least a single character (`^.+$`). By default, the input value is `hi`, but you can set it to anything. If you use `interactive` mode, then you will find `yo` and `what's up` as optional values.

In order to set the value, you can run the task with `parameter` or `interactively`.

> __Note__: The run task with parameters is preferable if you want to run the Zaruba task from your CI/CD or other automation tools. Meanwhile, run task interactively allows you to use lesser muscle memory.

### Run with parameter

```sh
zaruba please print user.sentence=free
```

![Run task with parameter](images/concept-run-with-parameter.png)


### Run interactively

```sh
zaruba please print -i
```

When you run a task interactively, Zaruba will ask you to set your input's value.

![Run interactively (input)](images/concept-run-interactively-1.png)

It will then run the task based on your input.

![Run interactively (result)](images/concept-run-interactively-2.png)

## üîÄ Dependencies

In real life, tasks might depend on each others. For example, you cannot run a database migration before the database server is running.

To declare task dependencies, you can use `dependencies` key:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
inputs:

  user.sentence:
    default: hi
    options: [yo, what's up]
    prompt: Write something
    description: |
      User sentence, cannot be empty.
    validation: ^.+$


tasks:

  print:
    extend: core.runShellScript
    inputs:
    - user.sentence
    config:
      sentence: '{{ .GetValue "user.sentence" }}'
      start: toilet -f mono12 -F metal '{{ .GetConfig "sentence" }}'

  
  runDb:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: runDb


  compile:
    extend: print
    config:
      sentence: compile
  

  runMigration:
    extend: print
    dependencies:
    - runDb
    - compile
    config:
      sentence: migrate
```

`runMigration` depends on both `runDb` and `compile`. That's mean that `runMigration` won't be started before `runDb` and `compile` are completed.

When you invoke `runMigration`, Zaruba will automatically run it's dependencies tasks (`runDb` and `compile`) in parallel/concurrently.

```sh
zaruba please runMigration
```

![Dependencies](images/concept-dependencies.png)

Notice that `compile` and `runDb` outputs are interlaced to each other since they run in parallel.

## üõ§Ô∏è Env

Many applications can be configured by using environment variables. Typically, people use environment variable for:

* activate/deactivate feature flag
* define connection string
* define HTTP port
* etc

You can set environment variable by performing:

```sh
ENVIRONMENT_NAME=value
```

You can also get environment variable value by using `$ENVIRONMENT_NAME`:

```sh
echo $ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

To set/get environment variable value programmatically, you can refer to the programming language documentation.

Two different applications might accidentally depend on the same variable name. Zaruba solve this by providing `from` key.

Let's check this example:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  showMyName:
    extend: core.runShellScript
    config:
      start: echo $NAME
    env:
      NAME:
        from: MY_NAME
        default: blank
  

  showYourName:
    extend: core.runShellScript
    config:
      start: echo $NAME
    env:
      NAME:
        from: YOUR_NAME
        default: blank

  
  showEveryoneName:
    dependencies:
    - showMyName
    - showYourName
```

To see how things work, you can invoke:

```sh
MY_NAME=joe YOUR_NAME=john zaruba please showEveryoneName
```

![Using env](images/concept-env.png)

### ü§ù Sharing Env

Just like `config`, you can share `env` among your tasks by using `envRef` or `envRefs`.




## üèÅ Service Task

> __Note__: Here we will create tasks manually. In real life, you can invoke `zaruba please makeServiceTask` to generate the tasks.

So far we have deal with `command task` and how to configure it using `inputs`, `config`, and `env`.

In some cases, you probably want to run a long-running process (e.g: web server, database server, scheduler, etc). In order to do that, you need a `service task`.

A `service task` is a task with both `start` command and `check` command available.

Let's see at the following example:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  runServer:
    env:
      PYTHONUNBUFFERED:
        default: 1
    start:
      - python
      - '-m'
      - http.server
      - 3000
    check:
      - bash
      - '-c'
      - |
        until nc -z localhost 3000
        do
          sleep 1
        done
        echo "check completed"
```

You can see that `runServer` has two commands:

* `start`: Start a static server (using python's `http.server`) on port 3000
* `check`: Perform `sleep 1` until localhost:3000 is accessible, then show "check completed".

To start it, you can invoke:

```sh
zaruba please runServer
```

![Service task](images/concept-service-task.png)

To make your task declaration shorter, you can extend from `core.startService`: 

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  runServer:
    extend: core.startService
    env:
      PYTHONUNBUFFERED:
        default: 1
    config:
      start: python -m http.server 3000
      ports: 3000
```

`core.startService` will automatically put port-checking into your `check` command for you.

## üê≥ Docker Task

> __Note__: Here we will create tasks manually. In real life, you can invoke `zaruba please makeDockerTask` to generate the tasks.

You have see how `service task` works and how it is different from `command task`. Now let's see how you can make a `docker task` to run a container.

You can make docker task by extending `core.startDockerContainer`. Also, you need to provide several `config` to configure the task:

* `useImagePrefix`: Either you want to use image prefix or not. Since we want to fetch images from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/), we set this to `false`.
* `imagePrefix`: If you choose to `useImagePrefix`, you can specify the prefix here. 
* `imageName`: Image name.
* `imageTag`: Image tag. You can leave it blank.
* `containerName`: Container name.
* `volumes`: Bind host path to container volume.

Now let's try to run two docker containers, redis and mysql: 

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  runRedis:
    extend: core.startDockerContainer
    config:
      useImagePrefix: false
      imageName: redis
      containerName: redis
      ports: 6379


  runMySql:
    extend: core.startDockerContainer
    config:
      useImagePrefix: false
      imageName: mysql
      containerName: mysql
      ports: 3306
    env:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:
        default: too


  run:
    dependencies:
    - runRedis
    - runMySql
```

You can run the tasks by invoking:

```sh
zaruba please run
# or alternatively:
zaruba please runRedis runMySql
```

Behind the scene, a docker task will try to:
* Pull image in case of it is not available in your local machine
* Create container
* Run container
* Check container state and it's exposed ports.

You probably need to wait a little while before seeing you containers running:

![Docker task](images/concept-docker-task.png)

### üê≥ Stop Container

When you press ctrl + c, the containers will keep running in the background. This will save you some time in case of you want to start . 

To actually stop the containers you need to run `docker stop <containerName>`. Another alternative is by extending `core.stopDockerContainer` as follow:

```yaml
# Filename: main.zaruba.yaml
tasks:

  runRedis:
    extend: core.startDockerContainer
    configRef: redis


  runMySql:
    extend: core.startDockerContainer
    configRef: mySql
    env:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:
        default: too


  run:
    dependencies:
    - runRedis
    - runMySql


  stopRedis:
    extend: core.stopDockerContainer
    configRef: redis


  stopMySql:
    extend: core.stopDockerContainer
    configRef: mySql


  stop:
    dependencies:
    - stopRedis
    - stopMySql


configs:

  redis:
    useImagePrefix: false
    imageName: redis
    containerName: redis
    ports: 6379


  mySql:
    useImagePrefix: false
    imageName: mysql
    containerName: mysql
    ports: 3306
```

Now, if you really want to stop all containers, you can simply type:

```sh
zaruba please stop
```

![Stop](images/concept-docker-stop.png)

### üê≥ Remove Container

Similarly, you can extend `core.removeDockerContainer` if you need to remove the container.
