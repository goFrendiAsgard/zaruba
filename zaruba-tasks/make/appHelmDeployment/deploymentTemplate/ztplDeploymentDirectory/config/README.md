# Deployment config

This directory contains a deployment config (`config.json`).

Deployment config is auto-generated, and not intended to be edited manually.

To generate the deployment config, you can invoke the following:

```bash
# location: ztplDeploymentName
zaruba please prepareZtplDeploymentName
```
